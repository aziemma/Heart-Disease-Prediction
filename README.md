# Heart-Disease-Prediction
  Preventing Heart diseases has become more than necessary. Good data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases can improve the entire research and prevention process, making sure that more people can live healthy lives. This is where Machine Learning comes into play. Machine Learning helps in predicting the Heart diseases, and the predictions made are quite accurate.

This Project involved the analysis of a Heart Disease Dataset, with proper Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA).The models were split for training and evaluation using different machine Learning models for a Clasification Prediction.

I've used a variety of Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python, to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether heart disease is present or not.

## Machine Learning algorithms used:

- Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
- Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)
- K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)
- Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
- Random Forest (Scikit-learn)

Accuracy achieved: 90%(Logistic Regression)

Dataset used: [Kaggle Heart-Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)
